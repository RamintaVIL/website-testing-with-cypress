# Cypress Test Cases for Automation Exercise

Welcome to my portfolio of automated test cases created using Cypress for the Automation Exercise website. These tests help validate various features to ensure smooth functionality and a seamless user experience across the platform.

## 🧪 Test Cases

The following test cases have been implemented using Cypress:

✅ **Test Case 1: Register User**

    - Verifies that a new user can successfully register on the website.

✅ **Test Case 6: Contact Us Form**

    - Ensures that the "Contact Us" form works as expected and submits user inquiries correctly.

✅ **Test Case 7: Verify Test Cases Page**

    - Validates that the Test Cases page loads properly and displays the required information.

✅ **Test Case 9: Search Product**

    - Confirms the search functionality works by querying for a specific product and returning accurate results.

✅ **Test Case 10: Verify Subscription on Home Page**

    - Verifies that users can subscribe to the newsletter via the homepage.

✅ **Test Case 13: Verify Product Quantity in Cart**

    - Checks if the correct product quantity is displayed in the shopping cart.

✅ **Test Case 17: Remove Products From Cart**

    - Ensures users can successfully remove items from their shopping cart.

✅ **Test Case 21: Add Review on Product**

    -   Validates that users can submit a product review.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### 💫 Prerequisites

Before you can run the test cases locally, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** – [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
-   **NPM** (included with Node.js) or **Yarn**
-   **Git** – [Download Git](https://git-scm.com)

### 💻 Installation

To get the project set up locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone
https://github.com/RamintaVIL/website-testing-with-cypress
cd website-testing-with-cypress
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### 💨 Running Locally

There are two ways to run Cypress tests:

1. Interactive Mode

If you want to see the tests running step-by-step in a graphical interface, use the interactive mode. This will open a Cypress Test Runner where you can select specific test files and view their execution in a browser:

```bash
npm run test
```

2. Headless Mode

If you prefer to run all tests in the background without opening a browser, use headless mode. This is faster and runs the tests directly in the terminal:

```bash
npm run test:cmd
```

After running the tests in headless mode, you will see the results in your terminal, including details on any failed or passed tests.

### 📝 Test Results

Once the tests are complete, the results will be displayed, including the number of tests that passed or failed. If a test fails, you can inspect the logs or screenshots (automatically generated by Cypress) to troubleshoot the issue.
